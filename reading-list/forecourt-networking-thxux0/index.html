as buying gas. We love our cars, we love our oil, and an industry about as old
as automobiles themselves has developed a highly consistent, fully automated,
and fairly user friendly system for filling the former with the latter.</p>
<p>I grew up in Oregon. While these rules have since been relaxed, many know
Oregon for its long identity as one of two states where you cannot pump
your own gas (the other being New Jersey). Instead, an attendant, employee
of the gas station, operates the equipment. Like Portland's lingering <em>indoor</em>
gas station, Oregon's favor for "full-service" is a holdover. It makes sense,
of course, that all gas stations used to be full-service.</p>
<p>The front part of a gas station, where the pumps are and where you pull up your
car, is called the <em>Forecourt.</em> The practicalities of selling gasoline, namely
that it is a liquid sold by volume, make the forecourt more complex than you
might realize. It's a set of devices that many of us interact with on a regular
basis, but we rarely think about the sheer number of moving parts and
long-running need for digital communications. Hey, that latter part sounds
interesting, doesn't it?</p>
<p>Electric vehicles are catching on in the US. My personal taste in vehicles
tends towards "old" and "cheap," but EVs have been on the market for long
enough that they now come in that variety. Since my daily driver is an EV,
I don't pay my dues at the Circle K nearly as often as I used to. One
of the odd little details of EVs is the complexity hidden in the charging
system or "EVSE," which requires digital communications with the vehicle
for protection reasons. As consumers across the country install EVSE in
their garages, we're all getting more familiar with these devices and their
price tags. We might forget that, well, handling a fluid takes a lot of
equipment as well... we just don't think about it, having shifted the whole
problem to a large industry of loosely supervised hazardous chemical
handling facilities.</p>
<p>Well, I don't mean to turn this into yet another discussion of the significant
environmental hazard posed by leaking underground storage tanks. Instead, we're
going to talk about forecourt technology. Let's start, then, with a rough,
sketchy history of the forecourt.</p>
<p><img src="https://computer.rip/f/gas/1.png" alt="Illustration from Triangle MicroSystems manual" /></p>
<p>The earliest volumetric fuel dispensers used an elevated glass tank where
fuel was staged and measured before gravity drained it through the hose
into the vehicle tank. Operation of these pumps was very manual, with an
attendant filling the calibrated cylinder with the desired amount of gas,
emptying it into the vehicle, and then collecting an appropriate sum of money.
As an upside, the customer could be quite confident of the amount of fuel they
purchased, since they could see it temporarily stored in the cylinder.</p>
<p>As cars proliferated in the 1910s, a company called Gilbarco developed a fuel
dispenser that actually measured the quantity of fuel as it was being pumped
from storage tank to vehicle... with no intermediary step in a glass cylinder
required. The original Gilbarco design involved a metal turbine in a small
glass sphere; the passing fuel spun the turbine which drove a mechanical
counter. In truth, the design of modern fuel dispensers hasn't changed that
much, although the modern volumetric turbines are made more accurate with a
positive displacement design similar to a Roots blower.</p>
<p>Even with the new equipment, fuel was sold in much the same way: an attendant
operated the pump, read the meter, and collected payment. There was,
admittedly, an increased hazard of inattentive or malicious gas stations
overcharging.  Volumetric dispensers thus lead to dispensers that automatically
calculated the price (now generally a legal requirement) and the practice of a
regulatory authority like the state or tribal government testing fuel
dispensers for calibration. Well, if consumers were expected to trust the gas
station, perhaps the gas station ought to trust the consumer... and these same
improvements to fuel dispensers made it more practical for the motorist to
simply pump their own gas.</p>
<p>At the genesis of self-serve gasoline, most stations operated on a postpayment
model. You pulled up, pumped gas, and then went inside to the attendant to pay
whatever you owed. Of course, a few unscrupulous people would omit that last
step. A simple countermeasure spread in busy cities: the pumps were normally
kept powered off. Before dispensing gasoline, you would have to speak with
the attendant. Depending on how trustworthy they estimated you to be, they
might just turn on power to the pump or they might require you to deposit some
cash with them in advance. This came to be known as "prepayment," and is now so
universal in th US that the "prepay only" stickers on fuel dispensers seem a
bit anachronistic <sup><a href="#fn-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>It's simple enough to imagine how this scheme worked, electronically. There is
separate power wiring to the pumps for each dispenser (and these stations
usually only had two dispensers anyway), and that wiring runs to the counter
where the attendant can directly switch power. Most gas stations do use
submersible pumps in the tank rather than in the actual dispenser, but older
designs still had one pump per dispenser and were less likely to use
submersible pumps anyway.</p>
<p>Soon, things became more complex. Modern vehicles have big gas tanks, and gas
has become fairly expensive. What happens when a person deposits, say, $20 of
"earnest cash" to get a pump turned on, and then pumps $25 worth of gas?
Hopefully they have the extra $5, but the attendant doesn't know that. Besides,
gas stations grew larger and it wasn't always feasible for the attendant to see
the dispenser counters out the window. You wouldn't want to encourage people
to just lie about the amount of gas they'd dispensed.</p>
<p>Gas stations gained remote control: using digital communications, fuel
dispensers reported the value of their accumulators to a controller at the
counter. The attendant would use the same controller to enable dispenser,
potentially setting a limit at which the dispenser would automatically shut
off. If you deposit $20, they enable the pump with a limit of $20. If you
pay by card, they will likely authorize the card for a fixed amount (this
used to routinely be $40 but has gone up for reasons you can imagine),
enable the dispenser with no limit or a high limit, and then capture the actual
amount after you finished dispensing <sup><a href="#fn-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>And that's how gas stations worked for quite a few decades. Most gas stations
that you use today still have this exact same system in operation, but it may
have become buried under additional layers of automation. There are two things
that have caused combinatorial complexity in modern forecourt control: first,
any time you automate something, there is a natural desire to automate <em>more</em>
things. With a digital communications system between the counter and the
forecourt, you can do more than just enable the dispensers! You might want to
monitor the levels in the tanks, update the price on the big sign, and sell
car wash vouchers with a discount for a related fuel purchase. All of these
capabilities, and many more, have been layered on to forecourt control systems
through everything from serial bus accessories to REST API third party
integrations.</p>
<p>Speaking of leaking underground storage tanks, you likely even have a
regulatory obligation to monitor tank levels and ensure they balance against
bulk fuel deliveries and dispenser totals. This detects leakage, but it also
detects theft, still a surprisingly common problem for gas stations. Your
corporate office, or your bulk fuel provider, may monitor these parameters
remotely to schedule deliveries and make sure that theft isn't happening with
the cooperation of the station manager. Oh, and prices, those may be set
centrally as well.</p>
<p>The second big change is nearly universal "CRIND." This is an awkward industry
acronym for everyone's favorite convenience feature, Card Reader IN Dispenser.
CRIND fuel dispensers let payment card customers complete the whole authorize,
dispense, and capture process right at the dispenser, without coming inside at
all. CRIND is so common today that it's almost completely displaced even its
immediate ancestor, "fuel island" outdoor payment terminals (OPTs) that provide
a central kiosk where customers make payments for multiple dispensers. This
used to be a pretty common setup in California where self-service caught on
early but, based on my recent travels, has mostly evaporated there.</p>
<p>So you can see that we have a complicated and open-ended set of requirements
for communication and automation in the fuel court: enabling and monitoring
pumps, collecting card payments, and monitoring and controlling numerous
accessories. Most states also require gas stations to have an intercom system
so that customers can request help from the attendant inside. Third-party
loyalty systems were briefly popular although, mercifully, the more annoying of
them have mostly died out... although only because irritating
advertising-and-loyalty technology has been better integrated into the
dispensers themselves.</p>
<p>Further complicating things, gas station forecourts are the epitome of legacy
integration. Fuel dispensers are expensive, concrete slabs are expensive, and
gas stations run on thin margins. While there aren't very many manufacturers
of fuel dispensers, or multi-product dispensers as they're typically called
today, the industry of accessories, control systems, and replacement parts
is vast. Most gas stations have accumulated several different generations of
control systems and in-dispenser accessories like tree rings. New features
like CRIND, chip payment, touchless payment, and "Gas Station TV" have each
motivated another round of new communications protocols.</p>
<p>And that's how we get to our modern world, where the brochure for a typical
gas station forecourt controller lists 25+ different communications
protocols—and assures that you can use "any mix."</p>
<p>Variability between gas stations increases when you consider the differing
levels of automation available. It used to be common for gas stations to use
standalone pump controllers that didn't integrate with much else—when you
prepaid, for example, the cashier would manually enter the pump number and
prepayment limit on a separate device from the cash register.</p>
<p>Here in New Mexico, quite a few stations used to use the Triangle MicroSystems
MPC family, a wedge-shaped box with an industrial-chic membrane keypad in
grey and bright red. Operation of the MPC is pretty simple, basically
pressing a pump number and then entering a dollar limit. Of course, the full
set of features runs much deeper, including financial reporting and fleet
fueling contracts.</p>
<p>This is another important dimension of the gas station control industry: fleet
fueling. It used to be that gas stations were divided into two categories,
consumer stations that took cash payment and "cardlock" stations that used an
electronic payment system. Since cardlock stations originally relied on
proprietary, closed payment agreements, they didn't sell to consumers and had
different control requirements (often involving an outside payment terminal).
As consumers widely adopted card payments, the lines between the two markets
blurred. Modern cardlock fueling networks, like CFN and Wex, are largely just
another set of payment processors. Most major gas stations participate in most
major cardlock networks, just the same as they participate in most major ATM
networks for lower-cost processing of debit cards.</p>
<p>Of course, more payment networks call for more integrations. The complexity
of the modern payment situation has generally outgrown standalone controllers,
and they seem to be fading away. Instead, the typical gas station today has
forecourt control completely integrated into their POS system. Forecourt
integration is such an important requirement that gas station convenience
stores, mostly handling normal grocery-type transactions, nevertheless
rely almost exclusively on dedicated gas station POS solutions. In other
words, next time you buy a can of Monster and a bag of chips, the cashier
most likely rings you up and takes payment through a POS solution offered
by the dispenser manufacturer (like Gilbarco Passport Retail) or one of
dozens of vendors that caters specifically to gas stations (including
compelling names like Petrosoft). Control of fuel dispensers is just too
weird of a detail to integrate into other POS platforms... or so it was
thought, although things clearly get odd as Gilbarco has to implement basic
<a href="https://computer.rip/2021-02-27-kitchen-videos.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kitchen video system</a>
integration for the modern truck stop.</p>
<p>So how does this all work technically? That's the real topic of fascination,
right? Well, it's a mess and hard to describe succinctly. There are so many
different options, and particularly legacy retrofit options, that one gas
station will be very different from the next.</p>
<p>In the days of "mechanical pumps," simple designs with mechanical counters,
control wiring was simple: the dispenser (really a mechanical device called a
pulser) was expected to provide "one pulse per penny" on a counting circuit
for dollars dispensed, which incremented a synchronized counter on the
controller. For control the other way, the controller just closed relays to
open "fast" or "slow" valves on the dispenser. The controller might also get a
signal when a handle lever is activated, to alert the attendant that someone
is trying to use a dispenser, but that was about it.</p>
<p>Later on, particularly as multi-product dispensers with two hoses and four
rates (due to diesel and three grades) became common, wiring all the different
pulse and valve circuits became frustrating. Besides, pumps with digital
counters no longer needed mechanical adjustment when prices changed, allowing
for completely centralized price calculation. To simplify wiring while enabling
new features, fuel dispenser manufacturers introduced simple current-loop
serial buses. These are usually implemented as a single loop that passes
through each dispenser, carrying small packets with addressed commands or
reports, usually at a pretty low speed. The dispensers designed for use with
these systems are much more standalone than the older mechanical dispensers,
and perform price accumulation internally, so they only needed to report
periodic totals during fueling and at the end of the transaction.</p>
<p>An upside of these more standalone dispensers is that they made CRIND easier to
implement: the payment terminal in the dispenser could locally enable the pump,
including setting limits, by a direct interface to the pump controller. Still,
the CRIND needed some way to actually authorize and report transactions.
Solution: another current loop. Most CRIND installations involved a second,
similar, but usually higher-speed serial bus that specifically handled
payment processing. The CRIND terminals in such a system usually communicated
with a back-office payment server using a very simple protocol, sending card
information in the clear. That back-office server might be in the back of the
convenience store, but it could also be remote.</p>
<p>As gas stations introduced CRIND, plastic card sales became a key part of the
business. Card volume is much greater than cash volume at most stations, and
it's known that customers will often leave rather than go inside if there
is a problem with CRIND payment. So gas stations prioritized reliability of
payments. To this day, if you look at the roof of many gas stations, you'll
find a small parabolic antenna pointed aimlessly skywards. By the end of the
1990s, many chain gas stations used satellite networks for payment processing,
either routinely (cheaper than a leased telephone line!) or as a contingency.
Cisco's VSAT terminal modules for edge routers, combined with a boutique
industry of Mbps-class data networks on leased transponders, made satellite
a fairly inexpensive and easy-to-obtain option for handling small payment
processing messages.</p>
<p>This arrangement of one current loop for dispenser control and one current loop
for payment terminals lasted for long enough that it became a de facto wiring
standard for the gas station forecourt. New construction gas stations provided
conduits from the convenience store to the pumps, and those conduits were
usually spec'd for an A/C power circuit (controlled, per code, by an emergency
stop button) and two low-voltage data circuits. The low-voltage data circuits
were particularly important because the electrical code and fire code impose
specific rules on electrical systems used in proximity to flammable
fluids—what's called a "hazardous environment" in the language of safety codes.
Dispenser manufacturers sold specialized field interconnection enclosures that
isolated the data circuits to the required safety standard, lowering the
complexity of the installation in the dispensers themselves <sup><a href="#fn-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p><img src="https://computer.rip/f/gas/2.png" alt="Illustration from Gilbarco manual" /></p>
<p>The next event to challenge forecourt infrastructure was the introduction of
EMV chip and tap-to-pay payment cards. Many Americans will remember how fuel
dispensers routinely had tap-to-pay terminals physically installed for years,
even a decade, before they actually started working. Modernizing dispensers
usually meant installing a new CRIND system with EMV support, but upgrades
to the underlying network to support them took much longer. The problem was
exactly the simplicity of the CRIND current loop design: EMV standards
required that all data be encrypted (you couldn't just send card numbers to
the backend in the clear as older systems did), and required larger and
more numerous messages between the payment network, the terminal, and the
card itself. Even if supporting EMV transactions on the serial bus was
possible, most manufacturers chose not to, opting for the vastly simpler
design of direct IP connectivity to each CRIND terminal.</p>
<p>But how do you put IP over a simple two-wire serial bus? Well, there are a
lot of options, and the fuel dispenser industry chose basically all of them.
There were proprietary solutions, but more common were IP networking
technologies adapted to the forecourt application. Consider DSL: for a good
decade, many forecourt interconnection boxes and fuel dispenser controllers
supported good old fashioned DSL over the payment loop (not to be confused
with DSL as in Diesel, an abbreviation also used in the fuel industry).</p>
<p>Bandwidth requirements increased yet further, though, with the introduction
of Maria Menounos. "Forecourt media" advertising systems can deliver full
video to each dispenser, a golden opportunity to pitch credit cards and
monetize something called "Cheddar." While there was a long era of satellite
transponders delivering analog video to chains for in-store marketing (I
will one day write about WalMart TV), the "GSTV" phenomenon is newer and
completely internet-based. For HD video you need a little better than the
5Mbps performance that industrial DSL systems were delivering. Enter

<p>Despite HomePlug's limited market success, it has been widely adopted in
gas station forecourts. The advantage of HomePlug is clear: it dispenses with
the control wiring loops entirely, providing IP communications with dispensers
over the electrical supply wiring. It usually presents an almost zero-wiring
upgrade, just adding HomePlug boards on both ends, so even in stations with
good forecourt serial loops, dispenser upgrades often end in a switch to
HomePlug.</p>
<p>The most interesting thing about these networks is just how modular it all
still is: somewhere in your local gas station, there is a forecourt controller.
Depending on the age of the system, that might be a bespoke embedded system
with plug-in modules, or it might be a generic N100 Mini PC with a few serial
ports and mostly IP connectivity. There is likely a forecourt interconnection
box that holds not just the wiring terminals but also adapter boards that
convert between various serial protocols, IP carriers, and control signals.
The point of sale backend server might interact with the forecourt controller
via IP, but older systems used RS-232... and systems in between might use
the same logical protocol as they did with RS-232, but encapsulated in TCP.
The installation manuals for all of these products include pages of wiring
diagrams for each different scenario.</p>
<p>Next time you stop at a gas station and find the CRIND not working, think
about all of that: whatever technician comes out to fix it will have their
work cut out for them, just to figure out which way that gas station is
set up.</p>

<p>In more rural areas of poorer states such as my own, you will still
find gas stations where the attendant turns the pump on after eyeing you.
These are mostly stations that just haven't had the money to install newer
equipment, which as we will see can be a big project. I have lived here for
about a decade, long enough to have noticed a significant decline in the
number of these stations still operating.<a href="#fnref-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">↩</a></p></li>

<p>For most payment card technologies, "authorizing" and "capturing" are separate
steps that can be done with different dollar amounts. This model of paying for
gas is one of the reasons why.<a href="#fnref-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">↩</a></p></li>
<li>
<p>For example, UL standards require physical separation between mains
voltage wiring and plumbing components inside of fuel dispenser enclosures.
The enclosures are actually rather crowded spaces, so that can turn into a
real hassle—and a selling point for low-voltage-only control systems. Fuel
dispenser enclosures are also required to contain a fuel fire due to leaking
plumbing, which is why you see fairly heavy sheet metal construction with
the sides forming chimney-like vents.<a href="#fnref-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">↩</a></p></li>
